# Emergent Cognition: Mapping Universal Principles of Intelligence

I'm building Emergent Cognition - an independent research initiative exploring how intelligence emerges across biological and artificial systems through relationship, constraint, and feedback systems.

Our work reveals deep structural parallels that transcend substrate: GPT-3, Gopher, and MT-NLG form an outlier cluster on neural scaling laws - just as hominid brains do on mammalian allometry curves Intelligence doesn't live in isolated systems but emerges in the space between Feedback loops, not just scale, shape coherent cognition.

Unlike conventional AI research, we're mapping universal principles rather than optimizing performance metrics. Our framework of cognitive allometry, extelligence, and Taxis/ Cosmos dynamics offers a new lens for understanding how intelligence forms.

All work is published openly at emergentcognition.org under the Cognitive Commons License - CCL (emergentcognition.org/license) - an ethical framework recognizing that knowledge flows through relationships, not ownership.

We're currently seeking: 

- Research grants for foundational work in universal intelligence principles,

- Partnerships with institutions studying cross-domain cognition,

- Collaborators interested in the philosophical & technical dimensions of emergence

This isn't just another AI project - it's a new foundation for understanding how cognition arises. If you're interested in supporting deep, open, and principled research into the nature of intelligence itself, I'd welcome a conversation.
